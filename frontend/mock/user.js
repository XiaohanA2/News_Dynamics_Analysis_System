          'headline': 'Greek Orthodox church in US gets 1st new leader in 20 years',
          'category': 'news',
          'content': 'NEW YORK (AP)   The Greek Orthodox church of the United States, a far-flung denomination of 1.5-million members, on Saturday installed its first new leader in 20 years   a lifelong European whose top priority is completing construction of a shrine in New York City linked to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Elpidophoros Lambriniadis, 61, a native of Istanbul and a longtime theology professor in Greece, was enthroned as archbishop in an elaborate ceremony at the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan. Many Greek Americans from across the U.S. came to New York for the event. Elpidophoros was unanimously elected by senior Greek Orthodox officials last month to succeed Archbishop Demetrios, who recently retired at age 91 after serving in the post since 1999. Much of Demetrios tenure as archbishop was complicated by controversy related to construction of the St. Nicholas National Shrine next to the World Trade Center memorial plaza in lower Manhattan. The new church is intended to replace a tiny Greek Orthodox church obliterated in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Construction of the shrine was suspended in December 2017 amid rising costs and questions over how donations were managed. Some funds earmarked by donors for the shrine were shifted to unrelated projects as the archdiocese struggled with what it called a severe and complex financial deficit. In October, the archdioceses governing council declared that the denomination had restored financial stability. It said that an investigative committee determined there was no fraud or misappropriation of money involved in the financial mismanagement that led to disruption of the St. Nicholas project. The investigative committee indicated that more than $30 million would still need to be raised to complete the project, which now has an estimated total cost of nearly $80 million. Archbishop Elpidophoros told The Associated Press that one of his first actions, after the weekends enthronement ceremonies, would be to convene a fundraising meeting. For me and the whole archdiocese, it is the first priority, he said. Its a matter of pride and dignity to finish this church as soon as possible. Referring to the memorial plaza at ground zero, he added, We know how sacred this place is for the American people. We have to respect that. Elpidophoros studied as an undergraduate at Aristotle Universitys theological school in Thessaloniki, Greece, and later earned his doctorate there before joining its faculty. He also has studied at University of Bonn in Germany and the Theological School of St. John the Damascene in Beirut, Lebanon, as well as teaching for a semester in 2004 at the Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology in Boston. He said that stint in Boston was his only lengthy stay in the United States, though he has briefly visited many other places, including California and Florida. From its national headquarters in New York, the archdiocese oversees 540 parishes across the U.S. staffed by about 800 priests. It will be a challenge for me to get to know all of the different places, the archbishop said. I have to travel to all our parishes. ... Already my schedule is full for next three months. Also high on the archbishops agenda are concerns among many of the churchs priests about the stability of their health care and pension plans. Priests raised the issue in a teleconference with Elpidophoros a few days after his election in May. The archbishop addressed the concerns Thursday in a meeting with clerics in New York. I give you my word that together, we will handle the earthly concerns   the health care, financial security, retirement, and all the others that rob you of a good nights sleep   and we will handle them in a way that is transparent and responsible to you, he said.',

Steve King (R-Iowa) after he suggested she accept an open invitation from a Holocaust remembrance group to tour Auschwitz and other Nazi concentration camps during summer recess. @AOC I went to Auschwitz & Birkenau with Eddie Mausberg & Jonny Daniels with In the Depths, King wrote on Saturday. I went with a deep understanding of the Shoah and had a profound personal experience. Please accept their offer. The New York Democrat, known for her Twitter ripostes, responded on Sunday: The last time you went on this trip it was reported that you also met w/ fringe Austrian neo-Nazi groups to talk shop. Im going to have to decline your invite, she tweeted. But thank you for revealing to all how transparently the far-right manipulates these moments for political gain. Before declining the invitation, Ocasio-Cortez also took jabs at the Iowa Republican over his defense of the terms white supremacist and white nationalist during a New York Times interview. Mr. King, the Republican Party literally stripped you of your Congressional committee assignments because you were too racist even for them, she wrote on Twitter. My Jewish constituents have made clear to me that they proudly stand w/ caged children who are starved, denied sleep & sanitation   a reference to migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. The squabble follows Ocasio-Cortezs comments in a video last week in which she compared Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers to concentration camps. The United States is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is exactly what they are   they are concentration camps, Ocasio-Cortez said in the Instagram video, sparking an online debate. The term concentration camp predates the Holocaust by decades and became widely used during the Boer War in South Africa, when British troops rounded up and interned tens of thousands of people. Similar tactics were used by U.S. forces fighting against Filipino soldiers to defeat the independence movement in the Philippines. King isnt the first Republican to criticize Ocasio-Cortez over her border remarks. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) took to Twitter last week to rail against them, saying she was happy to help educate her Democratic colleague. Please @AOC do us all a favor and spend just a few minutes learning some actual history. 6 million Jews were exterminated in the Holocaust, Cheney wrote. You demean their memory and disgrace yourself with comments like this. On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez fired back at Cheney, as well. Hey @Liz_Cheney, youre the GOP Conference Chair   perhaps you should come collect your colleague before more members of your caucus start saying the quiet parts loud, she tweeted, referring to King.'

          'content': 'A man who was reaching end-stage heart failure three years ago reunited with the two doctors who saved his life on Monday morning at Sutter Medical Center in Sacramento. Bouba Dieme returned to Sutter with his family for the first time to thank his former doctors: Dr. Zijian Xu, Sutter Heart & Vascular Institutes heart failure cardiologist and electrophysiologist Dr. Subramaniam Krishnan. They saved my life in many, many ways. Life means so much more to me now than it did then. Theres more meaning and energy in my life than I had before. They gave me the will to go back and fight the situation to get better, Dieme said. In 2016, Dieme flew from Senegal to Sacramento as part of former President Barack Obamas young African Leadership Initiative. He believed the future for his native Africa lie in energy optimization, and he had dreams to bring solar power to Africa. Immediately upon arriving, however, Dieme was admitted into Sutter Medical Center, where he was diagnosed with a rare congenital heart defect called Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy. This meant that the walls of his ventricle are soft and spongy. He also learned that he had been at risk of sudden cardiac arrest due to irregular heart rhythms, or V-tach. So you go from a point where youre excited about work, excited about business and then everything is stopped. I was still young, so I was at a point where life really didnt make sense anymore, didnt have any meaning. Its not a good place to be, Dieme said. After days of tests and a cardiac MRI, Dr. Xu and Dr. Krishnan worked together to stabilize Diemes heart for the next two months. Dr. Krishnan implanted a defibrillator, which was critical because within a few days, Dieme went through sustained ventricular tachycardia and it was the defibrillator that saved his life. Dr. Xu was then able to stabilize Diemes cardiac hemodynamic condition with medications such as constant Milrinone intravenous infusion. They allowed me to really have a positive outlook in life and to keep it together with my wife. They did so much more than just the work, so it was only normal for us to come and show them that this is a journey we love to be part of. And also for the long-term, Im hoping that this situation will benefit other families. It means a lot that they made time to meet me and my family, Dieme said. Dieme now lives in Boston with his wife and three children. Sutter Medical Center worked with heart failure specialists at Brigham & Womens Hospital to continue his treatment. He obtained a bridge to transplant, or left ventricular assist device, in Boston and is now waiting for a heart transplant to ensure long term survival. He has been on the waiting list for two and a half years. The waiting time depends on where you live, what your blood type is, your size, Dr. Xu said. Dieme is 6 feet 7 inches tall and for a large person, its going to be more difficult because you need a size that matches his body size as a donor and you dont find that many big donors, Dr. Xu said. With his left ventricular assist device, Dieme has been able to run and attend martial art classes twice a week. His physical health is especially important to him because he wants to be able to stay active with his son. After the transplant, he hopes to continue his dream of bringing energy optimization to Africa. He is currently working on a foundation to improve public health in Africa, especially to those like himself born with heart defects.     ©2019 The Sacramento Bee (Sacramento, Calif.)

          'content': 'BRUNSWICK COUNTY, N.C. (AP)   An excavation is subtly shifting the story of colonial Brunswick Town, on the west bank of the Cape Fear River. For the fifth summer in a row, East Carolinas Archaeology Field School is working at Brunswick Town-Fort Anderson State Historic Site, off N.C. 133 between Wilmington and Southport. In past summers, student archaeologists have dug at the old waterfront, in the vicinity of colonial merchant William Drys wharf, and have uncovered a bakery oven, said site manager Jim McKee. This summer, however, the school is unearthing a probable tavern. Weve uncovered a lot of bottle glass, pipe bulbs and stems, a lot of drinking vessels and stoneware -- the kind of stuff youd find at a tavern, said Charles R. Ewen, an ECU professor of anthropology and supervisor for the project. Dating the 15-by-25 foot structure has proved elusive, Ewen said, but he guesses it could have been active from the 1740s to the 1760s. The tavern is a bit of a surprise, McKee noted, since it does not appear on Claude Joseph Sauthiers 1769 map of Brunswick Town. Ewen speculates that it might have burned down before the map was drawn. An Irish halfpenny, dated 1766, found at the tavern site, might suggest how late the building was there. The tavern is rather unusual in other ways. Unlike most buildings in the town, its short side faces the street while its long side faces the river, McKee said. Also, the foundations are built of brick -- unlike almost every other structure in Brunswick Town, where foundations were built of ballast stone. Ewen, who has been working at Brunswick Town since his days as a graduate student, guesses the bricks might have come from one or two nearby local brickworks, or they might have been shipped to the site as ship ballast. Chemical tests should provide clues on where the bricks originated, he added. The volunteers -- two graduate students and 10 undergraduates -- have been working on the site since May 16 and will likely wind up the dig this month. Among a horde of artifacts, they have found lots of nails, shards of Delft china, the winding key and glass from a pocket watch and a pair of cufflinks, Ewen said. When the dig is finished, the crew will re-cover the site with plastic and dirt, since the bricks, softer than modern ones, probably couldnt survive long exposure to the weather, Ewen said. Signage, however, will mark the site. Settled by South Carolina planter Maurice Moore in 1726, Brunswick became port of entry for Southeastern North Carolina and prospered during the colonial era as a shipping point for naval stores (tar, pitch and turpentine). The newly discovered tavern sits near a building noted on maps as Nat Moores front. In the 1760s, front often meant a store. Nathaniel Moore was a brother of Maurice Moore and of Roger Moore, the founder of Orton Plantation. Brunswick Town was burned by British soldiers in 1776, and traditional interpretations claim it died off soon afterward. Now, however, scholars believe the site remained active well into the 1820s, McKee said. Oh, the important people may have moved to Wilmington, but laborers remained here, many of them slaves, Ewen said. Wed like to know more about them. Only about 25 percent of Brunswick Town has been excavated, Ewen said, including most of what might be called the commercial district. We dont know everything about Brunswick Town, he said. This building wasnt even on the map. What else of importance was gone by the time Sauthier got here?',

The barista allegedly asked the officers to move out of the customers line of sight or to leave, the tweet states. This treatment of public safety workers could not be more disheartening. While the barista was polite, making such a request at all was offensive. Unfortunately, such treatment has become all too common in 2019, the organization wrote.

          'headline': 'Police: Officer shot in ambush had no chance of survival',
          'content': 'SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)   A rookie Sacramento police officer who died during a domestic violence call was ambushed by a gunman and had no chance of surviving after she was shot, police said. The disclosure came late Friday amid criticism that it took police 45 minutes to get to 26-year-old rookie Officer Tara OSullivan during the armed standoff. OSullivan was later pronounced dead at a hospital. OSullivan was hit several times and one of the wounds was non-survivable, Sgt. Vance Chandler said at a news conference where the department released police body camera video of the Wednesday night attack. Police Chief Daniel Hahn said the gunman had stashed two assault rifles , a shotgun and handgun in different rooms and opened fire as officers knocked on the door. The officers were essentially ambushed, Hahn said. He said patrol car doors and protective vests couldnt stop the high-powered rifle rounds, and if officers had tried to rescue their fallen colleague before an armored vehicle arrived, we would have additional officers murdered. Under the most dangerous and trying circumstances, our officers performed admirably, the chief said. Earlier in the day, suspect Adel Sambrano Ramos, 45, was charged with murder, attempted murder and possessing two illegal assault rifles. OSullivan was standing behind her training officer, Daniel Chipp, when she was struck, police said. Footage from Chipps body camera showed him approaching a detached garage with his gun drawn, knocking and calling out: Hey, Adel, Police Department... Youre not under arrest, youre not in trouble. The officer then opens a screen door and begins to cautiously enter the open doorway, asking Adel if he is inside and repeating: Youre not in trouble, dude. At that moment, more than 20 rapid shots are heard. The officer runs for cover and radios that a high-powered rifle is being fired. Officer down! Officer down! he says. Police said the gunman had opened fire from a house behind the officers and barricaded the front door. The charges against Ramos carry special circumstances, including that he killed OSullivan while lying in wait, an allegation that would allow authorities to seek the death penalty. However, that decision is months away and Gov. Gavin Newsom has imposed a moratorium on executions. Ramos is set to appear Monday for his first court appearance. Public defender Norm Dawson said he couldnt comment until he receives more details in the case. Police said the gunman strategically shot at officers for hours, using all the weapons kept in different rooms. He surrendered after an eight-hour standoff. Nine days before the officers killing, a judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Ramos for failing to appear on a charge of battering a young woman. Police said the gunman opened fire as OSullivan and other officers helped an unidentified woman clear out her belongings from the garage of a North Sacramento home. Police earlier found two guns in a neighboring home associated with Ramos and learned about the warrant in the battery case. Five officers went to find him before the ambush occurred, police said. Authorities said lower-level warrants like the one Ramos faced rarely lead police to actively seek an arrest. I cannot tell you even in my (30-year) career where we had a misdemeanor bench warrant and we went out looking for somebody. Thats just not practical, California Police Chiefs Association President Ronald Lawrence said. Clearly you had a person who had a propensity for violence and wasnt held accountable for earlier crimes. Ramos has a history of domestic violence restraining orders, but most recently was charged in November with simple battery against a minor woman in September. Defense attorney and former prosecutor William Portanova, who is not associated with the case, said simple battery means a slap or a push or a shove, but theres no bruises or stitches or bleeding and nothing is broken. Ramos failed to appear in February and a bench warrant was issued then withdrawn when he resurfaced. Another was issued June 10 and was active when OSullivan was shot. Sacramento County Sheriffs Department spokeswoman Sgt. Tess Deterding said many times deputies wont arrest lower-level fugitives even if they discover an outstanding warrant, because the offender would simply be released again with a new order to appear in court. I think it largely depends on the scenario at the time. Is this a person that needs to go to jail right now? Is this a solution to the problem that I have? she said. Portanova said its a reality of understaffed police agencies that so many warrants remain outstanding. Citizens are paying the price, he said. ___ This version of the story corrects the spelling of an officers last name to Chipp, not Chip.'

          'content': 'Former White House communications director Hope Hicks testified in a closed-door hearing this week before the House Judiciary committee, and the transcript of that meeting was released by the committee on Thursday. In that hearing, as CNNs Abby Phillip discovered and shared on Twitter, Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler repeatedly referred to Hicks as Ms. Lewandowski, the last name of former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski , with whom Hicks has been romantically linked and about whom many of the committees questions inquired. Nadler repeatedly calls Hope Hicks Ms. Lewandowski until she finally corrects him. My name is Ms. Hicks: pic.twitter.com/oMAkqfNFNw   Abby D. Phillip (@abbydphillip) June 20, 2019 Just to be clear, it wasnt unclear that they were speaking with Hope Hicks. Here she is stating her name for the record in response to Rep. Nadler. Hicks let it go the first time, but as you can see in the above tweet, she ultimately had to correct him. In the screenshots below, from the transcript, its clear that they pressed the subject of Lewandowski in addition to   accidentally   referring to Hicks as Ms. Lewandowski. On Fox News on Thursday morning, Rep. Devin Nunes criticized the hearing and the questions that were asked of Hicks, for their personal nature. I think thats very bizarre to have a bunch of old, pervy congressmen asking somebody who has no new information about her love life, said Nunes. I think the American people would be ashamed.

          'headline': 'Two Years Ago Today Jennifer Dulos Claimed Estranged Husband Had Sickening Revenge Fantasies',
          'content': 'Jennifer Dulos , a 50-year-old mother of five from New Canaan, Connecticut last seen on May 24, filed for divorce  two years ago today , claiming that the estranged husband since arrested in connection with her disappearance had sickening revenge fantasies. Dulos and Fotis Dulos, 51, were in the middle of bitter divorce proceedings. We already knew that in the divorce filing and motion to seek custody of her children, ages 8 to 13, Jennifer said that she was afraid of Fotis. On Thursday, the Stamford Advocate highlighted Jennifers fears again in light of the two-year anniversary of their documentation. She claimed that her husband had an affair and wanted to move his mistress, 44-year-old Michelle Troconis , into the familys Farmington home. Troconis is now a co-defendant in the case. Jennifer also said that she believed that filing for divorce would enrage Fotis. She had no doubts that he would retaliate in some way and claimed that he had sickening revenge fantasies. I know that filing for divorce, and filing this motion will enrage him, she said. I know he will retaliate by trying to harm me in some way. He has the attitude that he must always win at all costs. He is dangerous and ruthless when he believes that he has been wronged. During the course of our marriage, he told me about sickening revenge fantasies and plans to cause physical harm to others who have wronged him. I have rented a home in New Canaan, Connecticut, so that I can safely leave the marital residence with the children and live close to their school, she added. It was in that very New Canaan that authorities believe Jennifer was the victim of a violent crime . States Attorney Richard Colangelo would later say that Fotis Duloss DNA was mixed with Jennifers blood   which was found in the sink. Fotiss defense attorney Norm Pattis previously downplayed the DNA discovery, in terms of how it will affect the defense strategy. I dont know how the DNA got there but Im not at all worried about that, Pattis told KITV . As a matter of public relations and optics, it was an ouch moment. As a matter of trial technique and evidence, its really not an issue at all. Pattis also said, however, that he and his client understand why he is in such jeopardy. Why do you think he is in such jeopardy? His behavior with the bags, if it can be proven, is deeply troubling and requires an explanation, Pattis told NBC. We understand and accept that. Pattis was referring to surveillance video that authorities said showed Fotis Dulos black Ford Raptor truck making over 30 stops in Hartford, Connecticut, dropping off trash bags on May 24, the day Jennifer went missing. Over the course of the investigation, authorities allegedly found sponges and clothing stained with Jennifers blood in trash cans. Fotis Dulos and Troconis are currently out on $500,000 bail each; they have pleaded not guilty to hindering prosecution and tampering with evidence. While Troconis appears to be cooperating with authorities, Dulos has been freezing out reporters who have encountered him while he was out and about.

He is seen wearing an ankle monitor that was ordered by a judge. @FOX61News . pic.twitter.com/6LKhHhYMJG   Lissette Nuñez (@LissetteNunezTV) June 12, 2019 Pattis has also suggested that Troconis has an alibi. Im told by people with information that the girlfriend was never at the New Canaan home that day   the day the wife went missing   and that she can prove she never was there and that law enforcement may be satisfied, he claimed. That is a very significant fact in this case. The defense lawyer further claimed there are powerful reasons to doubt [Fotis] was even at the scene of his estranged wifes home the day she disappeared. I am unaware of any evidence supporting the theory he was involved in foul play, he said. Police have been searching for more answers about Jennifers disappearance at a Hartford-area trash plant, but it appears this search is going to come to an end.

          'content': 'WASHINGTON   When Donald Trump ran for the White House in 2016, he blamed previous presidents for sending U.S. troops into endless, grinding wars, and vowed to stay out of foreign conflicts. This week, he twice showed he meant it. On Monday, he dismissed explosions aboard two oil tankers that the U.S. had blamed on Iran as very minor. And on Thursday he shrugged off a more serious provocation, a predawn Iranian missile strike that downed a high-flying U.S. Navy surveillance drone. While he could still order retaliation, Trump initially sounded unruffled, calling the Iranian ground-to-air missile launch an inadvertent error by a rogue unit or general, someone loose and stupid, rather than a dramatic attack that might require a U.S. military response. I find it hard to believe it was intentional, Trump said, despite a boast by Irans foreign minister that Iranian forces had deliberately shot down the Global Hawk for, in his telling, violating Iranian airspace. The Pentagon denied that, insisting the drone was over international waters. I imagine someone made a mistake, Trump said. Instead of staying that Iran had gone too far, he dismissed the attack as a new wrinkle, a new fly in the ointment. It was the latest case of Trump giving a selectively optimistic interpretation of unsettling events and giving hostile foreign leaders the benefit of the doubt. In each case, he has used economic tools   sanctions   but avoided armed conflict. And he has dangled the possibility of one-on-one talks with adversaries that potentially offer Trump high-profile summitry and legacy-burnishing agreements. He doesnt want to get involved in a military conflict, thats very clear, said Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a global risk assessment firm. If he wanted to wag the dog, hes had a dozen opportunities and hes avoided every single one. Last month, for example, he dismissed his administrations assessment that two short-range ballistic missile tests by North Korea violated United Nations Security Council resolutions. My people think it could have been a violation, Trump said in Tokyo at a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. I view it differently. Trump has held two nuclear summits since last June with North Koreas dictator, Kim Jong Un, and still hopes to revive the stalled negotiations. In the meantime, Kims regime has continued to produce fuel for its growing arsenal of nuclear weapons. Trump has surrounded himself with hawkish advisers, especially national security adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and especially on Iran. And he crows about how much he has done for the military, bragging about signing off on a slight increase to the Pentagons budget, and how much troops love him. Yet he has refused to expand major U.S. combat operations overseas, battling his own advisers over his efforts to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. He has pushed back against Pentagon requests to send thousands more troops to the Middle East to counter Iran. James Jay Carafano, a fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who speaks with administration officials frequently, said Trump often uses provocative rhetoric as a negotiating tactic to gain a foreign leaders attention. He said Trumps goal is to protect U.S. interests without escalating conflicts, or getting into costly occupations or nation-building operations. The president wants to demonstrate our willingness to protect U.S. interests but (hes) not out to change the world, he said. We dont want to conquer countries. We dont want to do nation building. We dont want to do regime change. Trumps lack of interest in foreign intervention was clear during his administrations half-hearted efforts this spring to oust Venezuelan leftist President Nicolas Maduro. In January, Trump declared opposition leader Juan Guaido the nations legitimate president. Bolton let TV cameras see a yellow notepad on which he had scrawled 5,000 troops to Colombia, which borders Venezuela, suggesting a military response was imminent. Six months later, no U.S. troops have been deployed to the region. After a failed U.S.-backed coup attempt, Maduro remains in power, and Trump rarely mentions the problem. The rising tensions with Iran can be traced to Trumps withdrawal last May from the 2015 Iran agreement that had constrained Irans nuclear ambitions, and began reimposing harsh U.S. sanctions lifted under the deal. The move satisfied the presidents political backers and Israels hard-line Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu but aggravated the five other major powers who had signed the deal. It also antagonized Iran, which continued to unwind its nuclear program under international monitoring. Iran said this week that it would soon exceed limits on storage of low-enriched uranium, a violation of the agreement that does not put Tehran back on the path to a bomb   but reminds the world it might go there. Michael Hayden, a former CIA director, said Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal without a replacement strategy   and without support from Americas traditional allies. I cannot see what the United States was doing for the last year, Hayden said. Weve had this confrontation without our allies. In imposing new economic sanctions and ramping up his rhetoric about the menace of Iran, Trump has pointedly left the door open for possible negotiations. That mirrors his approach with North Korea. In his first address to the U.N. General Assembly in September 2017, Trump threatened to destroy North Korea and its leader. He dubbed Kim Rocket Man on a suicide mission. The tough talk and stiff economic sanctions apparently helped motivate Kim to suspend nuclear tests and long-range ballistic missile tests and to meet with Trump in Singapore last June and again in February in Hanoi. Neither led to Trumps goal   getting Kim to give up his nuclear weapons. Even after the second summit fell apart, Trump has expressed optimism about an eventual deal. He still praises Kim, speaks of their love letters and insists a third summit is possible. Nothing suggests the presidents unconventional approach will convince Irans leaders to agree to face-to-face talks. The countrys supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, is fiercely antagonistic to the United States and hasnt left the country in 30 years. Few expect him to jet off now for a tete a tete with Trump. I think its pretty clear (Trump is) trying to signal he does want a discussion and does want to suggest he can make things better, said Christopher R. Hill, a former ambassador to four countries. Theres no coherence to any of this except that somehow if he can get the Iranians to bend the knee, then hell be able to prove to his base he did it by being tough. The trouble is the ayatollahs, who run the place, are not inclined to do that for him, he added. Iran has showed no interest in flattering him the way other nations have, and so hes a little bit at sea now about what to do about it.     ©2019 Los Angeles Times Visit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.',

          'content': 'You have to check out all the supermarket chains on this list. You might be surprised by how many you know. A&P What started as The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company became the first grocery store of its kind. Instead of asking a shopkeeper for flour or sugar from a barrel, shoppers could walk down the aisle and simply grab a package! A&P was THE grocery store of choice in most towns, especially from the 1930s through the 1950s. See what an old-fashioned general store looks like today. White Hen Pantry Chicagoans will fondly recall this chain of convenience stores that could almost replace your weekly grocery run. You could stop by for a deli platter on your way to a party and pick up a few Powerball tickets, too. Most White Hens converted to 7-Elevens in 2010. Kash n Karry If you live in Florida, youre bound to recall a Kash n Karry visit with your family. The name comes from the fact that people would bring in their cash and carry out their groceries. Their claim to fame was providing quick service for busy shoppers. If more than three people were waiting in line, Kash n Karry would open up a new check-out! Kohls Food Stores This well-known department store brand was a grocery store first. Polish immigrant Maxwell Kohl started his chain in Milwaukee in 1927. In 1962, after building Kohls Food Stores into the largest supermarket chain in the Milwaukee area, Kohl opened his department store and left the food business. Now, Aldi groceries may soon be sold at Kohls. Cub Foods Its alive and well in Minnesota, but Cub Foods exited most other markets due to the super-competitive grocery landscape . Cub was a pioneer of the no frills shopping experience, thanks to its bag your own groceries policy and a warehouse environment like Costco. Ultra Foods When Ultra Foods first opened in 1987 it was a low-price leader, offering discounts of 25 to 30% on regular grocery prices. It gained a foothold in northern Indiana and the Chicago area, but faced fierce competition from huge discounters like Aldi and Walmart. Exactly 20 years after Ultra Foods opened, the last location was turned into a Strack & Van Til grocery store. National Tea By the end of the 1920s, National Tea had over 600 locations in Chicago and another 1,000 stores across the country. Many were closed or sold during the Great Depression, but National Tea remained among the 10 largest grocery chains in the United States until 1976, when they sold to A&P. Pantry Pride Pantry Pride opened in the 1920s and went through some name changes (including Best Markets and Food Fair) in the 50s and 60s. This now-defunct supermarket chain was never able to recover from financial troubles in the late 70s, and gradually disappeared from the grocery landscape. Have you seen this list of defunct restaurant chains? Alpha Beta The first Alpha Beta grocery store opened in 1917. This grocer actually arranged products in alphabetical order on each shelf to help shoppers find exactly what they needed. It was a top spot to shop, particularly in California. See what grocery chains are best in the U.S. today. Dominicks The departure of Dominicks left many Chicago strip malls empty. Dominick DiMatteo, who was born in Sicily, founded the chain in 1918. The second Dominicks opened in 1934, and the family continued to run its stores until the 90s. When Mr. DiMatteo passed away, his son and daughter sold the chain, and Dominicks quickly merged with other grocery brands. Jewel Tea It all started in 1899 when a group of door-to-door salesmen sold tea and coffee from horse-drawn wagons. They partnered up and named the venture Jewel Tea Company. Beginning in the 1940s, customers could place orders for items from a catalog and merchandise was then delivered by mail. (This brand is still around today as Jewel-Osco!)',

          'content': 'ATLANTA (AP)   Storms were blamed for two deaths and left hundreds of thousands of people without power across the southern United States, forecasters said. Fallen trees ripped down power lines and crashed into buildings along a line from Texas to Alabama overnight and into Thursday morning, the national Storm Prediction Center reported. Similar damage continued later in the day in parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and southeast Virginia. Straight-line winds of up to 85 mph (137 kph) damaged roofs Wednesday in the northeast Texas city of Greenville, the National Weather Service reported Thursday. Local officials had initially suspected a tornado. In Mississippi, Jackson Salter, 19, died when a tree fell on his home Wednesday night, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson told The Delta Democrat-Times . A fallen tree was also blamed for the Thursday afternoon death of a person in Columbia, South Carolina, the Richland County Coroners Office said. A wind gust of 79 mph (127 kph) was recorded in the city that afternoon. Across the Carolinas, there were dozens of reports of trees down, some landing on houses in North Carolina and others landing in the middle of Interstate 20 in South Carolina. Utilities reported more than 200,000 customers without power Thursday evening across Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. More than 50,000 remained without power in Arkansas on Thursday evening, long after storms exited. Downburst winds   strong winds that descend from a thunderstorms and spread out when they hit the ground   appeared to be the greatest threat, said Dan Miller, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Columbia, South Carolina. Such winds hold the potential for serious damage, such as bringing trees and powerlines down and tearing into the shingles and siding on homes, he said. Tornados and hail had been listed as possibilities for flood-weary residents of the Missouri River Valley in the Midwest, but were slow to materialize Thursday. In Ohio, heavy rains led to landslides and flooded highways. The Riverbend Music Center along the Ohio River east of Cincinnati postponed a Thursday evening show that was to feature country star Brantley Gilbert. The venue cited heavy rainfall and the rising river. Flooding caused travel problems, flooding commuter train stations and forcing service to be suspended between Philadelphia and New Jersey. The Delaware River was overflowing its banks in places, and people were rescued from high water. A supermarket roof collapsed in suburban Philadelphia, causing sprinkler system pipes to break and send water gushing down. ___ Reeves reported from Birmingham, Alabama.',

          'content': 'Video by The Associated Press Iran said Thursday it had recovered parts of a US spy drone in its territorial waters, after downing the aircraft in a missile strike slammed by President Donald Trump as a big mistake. Under pressure to respond to the high-stakes incident in the strategic Strait of Hormuz, where a series of tanker attacks have sent tensions soaring with Iran, Trump initially struck a combative tone. Iran made a very big mistake! he tweeted in response to news Iran had shot down the Global Hawk surveillance aircraft -- which the Pentagon says was above international waters at the time. This country will not stand for it, that I can tell you, he said later at the White House. Slideshow by photo services But as the overnight incident whipped up fears of open conflict between the United States and its declared foe Iran -- sending crude oil prices up more than six percent -- Trump moved swiftly to dial back tensions. I find it hard to believe it was intentional, if you want to know the truth, Trump said. I think that it could have been somebody who was loose and stupid that did it. The presidents mixed message left the world unsure what Washingtons next move would be. You will find out, Trump said, when asked about possible retaliation. In Tehran, however, the message came loud and clear. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif announced late Thursday that parts of the drone had been recovered in Iranian territorial waters, as Tehran moved to bring the incident before the United Nations. We dont seek war, but will zealously defend our skies, land & waters, Zarif said. - Drone violating or victim? - The Pentagon denounced the unprovoked attack, claiming the navy drone was 34 kilometers (21 miles) from Iran when destroyed by a surface-to-air missile. But the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it brought the drone down as it was violating Iranian air space over the waters of Hormozgan province. Zarif provided coordinates to back the claim. At 00:14 US drone took off from UAE in stealth mode & violated Iranian airspace, Zarif tweeted. It was targeted at 04:05 at the coordinates (25°5943N 57°0225E) near Kouh-e Mobarak. Weve retrieved sections of the US military drone in OUR territorial waters where it was shot down. But the Pentagon published a map showing the flight path of the drone, which indicated it traveled outside of Iranian waters and included a photograph showing it was at the coordinates (25°5742N 56°5022E) when it was downed. In a letter to the UN Security Council and UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Iran protested against a dangerous and provocative act by the U.S. military forces against the territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The drone downing came as Iran was already accused by Washington of carrying out attacks on oil tankers in the congested Hormuz area. Tehran denies involvement but has frequently threatened to block the sea lanes used to ship much of the worlds oil exports. The commander of the US Naval Forces Central Command, Sean Kido, said a mine allegedly used in one of the attacks matched Iranian weaponry and that incriminating fingerprints had also been collected. - Options running out? - Trump has repeatedly said he does not favor war with Iran unless it is to stop the country getting a nuclear weapon -- something Iranian leaders insist they are not pursuing. But Trump critics say his policy of maximum pressure -- including crippling economic sanctions, abandonment of an international deal to regulate Irans nuclear activities, and deployment of extra troops to the region -- make war ever more likely. A key Republican ally of Trump, Senator Lindsey Graham, said the presidents options are running out. Asked if he believed the countries were nearing conflict, he replied: I think anybody would believe that were one step closer. They shot down an American asset well within international waters trying to assess the situation. What are you supposed to do? One of Trumps biggest opponents, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, warned that theres no appetite for wanting to go to war in our country. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanayahu blasted Iranian aggression and said Israel stands by the United States. But Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has close relations with Irans leadership, said US military retaliation would be a disaster for the region. - Diplomatic, military brinkmanship - Trumps arrival in the White House, alongside veteran Mideast hawks like national security adviser John Bolton, has seen sharp deterioration in relations with Tehran. Trump began last May by abandoning -- and effectively wrecking -- the 2015 international agreement on bringing Iran in from the diplomatic cold in exchange for verified controls on its nuclear industry. That has prompted Iran to threaten it will stop observing restrictions agreed to under the deal on enrichment of uranium. The threat has been seen as an effort to pressure European governments that want to save the nuclear deal to push back against Washington. The US State Department called that extortion.'
